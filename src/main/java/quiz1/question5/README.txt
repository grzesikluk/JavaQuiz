You produced a nice (console) multithreaded imaging processing application and deliver it to
your clients. You start getting conflicting feedback. Some say that it works perfectly, while
others complain that itâ€™s slow or sometimes slow. Moreover, different people have vastly
different run times, while processing the same dataset on comparable machines. What would
be the most likely cause of these issues?

-------
Same:
- application version
- data
- machines

Different:
- performance
- ?


If the app is not using any internet connections to get more data and it does not use database which might differ than
probably it is OS.
