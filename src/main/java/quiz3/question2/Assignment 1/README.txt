You are given two sets of images, coming from two different cameras, mounted on a stereoscopic
rig, placed on a drone/quadcopter. One of the cameras produces photos in the visible
spectrum (400-650nm), while the other produces photos in the near-infrared (650-900nm).
Given that the cameras are triggered simultaneously, provide a Java implementation of an
algorithm that can do pairwise alignment of the VIS and NIR images.
Input: one VIS image and one NIR image.
Output:
– an error message if the images cannot be aligned
– an image containing two channels, corresponding to the aligned VIS and NIR images
Images can be found here
